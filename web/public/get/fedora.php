<h1 class="title">Installing java-gnome on Fedora Core or RHEL</h1>

<p>java-gnome is part of the official GNOME language bindings suite, and as
such should be present in any recent Red Hat Linux system.</p>

<p>The following command will install the latest released version of the
bindings library:

<pre>
# yum install java-gnome
</pre>

<p>As java-gnome 4.0 is a completely new from-the-ground-up implementation, it
depends on a very modern version of GLib, GTK, and the other libraries in the
GNOME stack. While Fedora Core typically ships only a few months off the GNOME
release cycle, Red Hat Enterprise Linux is at times <i>years</i> behind, so you
may find you have to take extra steps to ensure the necessary prerequisites are
present. A Red Hat system with GNOME 2.18.<span class="x">x</span> installed
should be more than sufficient.</p>
